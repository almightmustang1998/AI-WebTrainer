                A trainer web app that guides you through the gym.
                I need to make a very long sentence so that it will seem
                as though I am filling a page when in reality I am not even
                adding a period to this wall of text. Except just then did I
                decide to add a period!
                Now I begin to bore you by copying and pasting many different
                texts, again, and again, and agina, not even checking if spelled 
                correctly blah, blah, blah, blah., Alright keeep reading this nonensene
                from my head and REAPATATE REAPEAT!!!
